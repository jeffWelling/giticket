- A user can init with an earlier version that doesn't setup filters.json,
  upgrade giticket, and then get an error because it will try to list tickets
while looking up a filter but filters.json won't exist.

- Treat git branch setup changes as database changes with migrations, trigger
  migration when thing is missing.
